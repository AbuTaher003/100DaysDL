# Data Augmentation:


<br>


`Data augmentation is a technique of artificially increasing the training set by creating modified copies of a dataset using existing data. It includes making minor changes to the dataset or using deep learning to generate new data points.In the case of image augmentation, we make geometric and color space transformations (flipping, resizing, cropping, brightness, contrast) to increase the size and diversity of the training set.`

## `Why we use Data Augmentation?`

- `To increase the number of data.`
- `Reduce Overfiting Problelm.`

**WE USE `ImageGenerator()` FROM KERAS.PREPROCESSING.IMAGE**
